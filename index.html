      <header style="margin-top: 0px;">The two axes of flexbox</header>
      <p>
        When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the
        main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the
        flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
        Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth
        understanding how they work from the outset.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main axis is defined by flex-direction, which has four possible
        values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>row</li>
        <li>row-reverse</li>
        <li>column</li>
        <li>column-reverse</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your
        flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis
        runs down the columns.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Start_and_end_lines">
      <header>Start and end lines</header>
      <p>
        Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption
        about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily
        weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern
        layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer
        assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and
        run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing one under the
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the flex-direction is row and I am working in English, then the start
        edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right. If
        I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be
        on the right and the end edge on the left.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_flex_container">
      <header>The flex container</header>
      <p>
        An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container.
        To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's
        display property to flex or inline-flex. As soon as we do this the
        direct children of that container become flex items. As with all
        properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a
        flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the
        following way.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Items display in a row (the flex-direction property's default is row).
        </li>
        <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
        <li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
        <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
        <li>The flex-basis property is set to auto.</li>
        <li>The flex-wrap property is set to nowrap.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using
        the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are
        more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will
        instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will
        stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size. You can see in the
        live example below how this looks.
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          .box {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br />
          }</code
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        Adding the flex-direction property to the flex container allows us to
        change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting
        flex-direction: row-reverse will keep the items displaying along the
        row, however the start and end lines are switched.
      </p>
      <div class="code">
        <code>
          .box {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;flex-direction: row-reverse;<br />
          }</code
        >
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Multi-line_flex_containers">
      <header>Multi-line flex containers</header>
      <p>
        While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause our
        flex items to wrap onto multiple lines. In doing so, you should consider
        each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution will happen
        across that line, without reference to the lines either side.
      </p>
      <p>
        To cause wrapping behaviour add the property flex-wrap with a value of
        wrap. Now, should your items be too large to all display in one line,
        they will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items
        that have been given a width, the total width of the items being too
        wide for the flex container. As flex-wrap is set to wrap, the items
        wrap. Set it to nowrap, which is also the initial value, and they will
        instead shrink to fit the container because they are using initial
        flexbox values that allows items to shrink. Using nowrap would cause an
        overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink small
        enough to fit.

        <code>
          .box {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br />

          }</code

        The flex-flow shorthand
      </header>
      <p>
        You can combine the two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap into the
        flex-flow shorthand. The first value specified is flex-direction and the
        second value is flex-wrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the live example below try changing the first value to one of the
        allowable values for flex-direction - row, row-reverse, column or
        column-reverse, and also change the second to wrap and nowrap.
      </p>
